# EtymoAgent
EtymoAgent is a machine learning-powered linguist agent designed to analyze words, determine their linguistic roots, predict their meanings, and suggest related words. This project aims to blend the power of machine learning with linguistic analysis, creating a useful tool for language enthusiasts.

## Features
- Determine the root of a word (e.g., Latin, Arabic, etc.)
- Predict the meaning of a word
- Suggest related words
- RESTful API for easy integration
- Optional web interface for user interaction

## Technologies
- Python for data processing and machine learning
- MongoDB/MySQL for storing word data and their etymology
- TensorFlow/Keras/Scikit-Learn for machine learning
- Flask/Django for the API
- Beautiful Soup/Scrapy for web scraping

## Structure
- data/: Store raw and processed data.
- models/: Store machine learning models and related scripts.
- api/: API for interacting with the ML model.
- scripts/: Scripts for various tasks like data scraping and database setup.
- web/: Optional web interface for user interaction.
- README.md: Project description and setup instructions.
- requirements.txt: List of project dependencies.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/EtymoAgent.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd EtymoAgent
    ```
3. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Set up the database (MongoDB/MySQL):
    ```sh
    python scripts/db_setup.py
    ```
5. Run the API:
    ```sh
    cd api
    python app.py
    ```
6. (Optional) Run the web application:
    ```sh
    cd web
    python app.py
    ```

## Usage
- Use the API to analyze words by sending a POST request with the word data.
- Access the web interface (if set up) to interact with EtymoAgent visually.
